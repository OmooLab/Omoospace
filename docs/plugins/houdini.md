# Houdini

Before everything starts, you may read [Omoospace docs](https://omoolab.github.io/Omoospace/latest/omoospace/) to facilitate understanding of some of the proprietary terms mentioned below. Currently this plugin has only been tested on windows, other operating systems are unknown.

## Installation

1. Download the latest release version of Omoospace-Houdini (choose your houdini python version). [https://github.com/OmooLab/Omoospace-Houdini/releases](https://github.com/OmooLab/Omoospace-Houdini/releases)

2. Unzip all files to any directory. e.g. `path/to/Omoospace-Houdini`

3. Reference it's package path to houdini package json file `houdiniX.Y/packages/env.json`.

```json
{
    "package_path": ["path/to/Omoospace-Houdini/packages"]
}
```

4. Then restart Houdini.

## Usage

Some handy features to organize your project in omoospace ways.

-   Get the current omoosapce and subspace route.
-   Quick access to 5 main directories.
-   Save the .hip file to the new omoospace.
-   Organize nodes' import/export paths.

### Get current omoosapce and subspace route

Every time you open a .hip file, the plugin will read the [Omoospace](https://omoolab.github.io/Omoospace/latest/omoospace/#overview) root path of this file, as well as its [Subspace Route](https://omoolab.github.io/Omoospace/latest/omoospace/#a-subspace-route-is-formed-by-combining-the-subspace-names-from-root-to-leaf). If the plugin not detect any omoospace of current .hip file (e.g. when you first open Houdini with an empty project), it will refer to default omoospace `C:\Users\{UserName}\Void`, and the subspace route will be `Void_Untitled`

#### Environment Variables

**$JOB** stores the omoospace root path, as it is the project root env defined by Houdini. So 5 main directories will be:

-   Contents `$JOB/Contents`
-   SourceFIles `$JOB/SourceFiles`
-   ExternalData `$JOB/ExternalData`
-   References `$JOB/References`
-   StagedData `$JOB/StagedData`

All import export paths should be relative to `$JOB`.

According to the omoospace rules, all HDA files should be under `$JOB/Contents`. So every time a .hip file opens, this plugin will automatically add all HDAs from `$JOB/Contents` into this .hip. You can think of these HDAs as project-specific, rather than global.

**$ROUTE** stores the subspace route, it is not a built-in env of Houdini, but it also will be written into the file. So technically file will work even if without this plugin configured.

#### Menu Items

**$JOB (UNC):** In addition to displaying the current Omoospace root directory, clicking on it opens the folder directory directly.

**$ROUTE:** In addition to displaying the current Subspace Route, clicking on it will copy it to the clipboard, so you can paste it directly.

**Update Envs** Anytime your manually move .hip file to new location in storage, `$JOB`, `$ROUTE` may change also. Remember to hit the botton "Omoospace - Update Envs" to update the envs. But if you "File - Save As" .hip, Even though the path is still changed, the plugin will automatically modify the environment variables for you whenever you execute the save.

**Change Path Format** For most cases the [UNC](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/io/file-path-formats) format is the best, but if you need to submit a file to a remote render farm, UNC may not be allowed by the remote render farm, then in that case click this button to switch to mounted disk.

### Quick access to 5 main directories.

5 main directories are added to the quick-access sidebar of the file selection dialog.

### Save the .hip file to the new omoospace.

If you need to start a new Omoospace, this feature will help you build it quickly, click Omoospace - Save to New Omoospace.
In the dialog, enter the name of the new Omoospace (required), and the name of the source file as Subspace (optional).

### Organize nodes' import/export paths.

Supports batch operation, you can select many nodes, then execute them once.

#### Import Paths

Right-click on a node, press Organize Import Paths (hotkey Ctrl + Shift + E) to quickly set the parameters of the node with respect to the export paths.
For example, the Sublayer LOP node:

When clicked, the following dialog will appear. Here you can choose whether or not to copy the entire parent folder instead of individual files.

#### Export Paths

Right-click on a node, press Organize Export Paths (hotkey Ctrl + Shift + E) to quickly set the parameters of the node with respect to the export paths.
For example, the File Cache SOP node:

#### Supported Nodes

Not all nodes currently support the "Organize Import/Export Paths" feature, and we can't predictably create presets for new nodes or set presets for other third-party nodes. Here is the list of currently supported nodes.
